## Goal Tracker

The goal tracker creates a weekly planner that you can customize with the daily tasks you want to complete.

It works like this:

At the top of the page, you can enter the 7-day week that you want to track. The tracker will default to the current date, but you can select any date you want with the date picker.

The Weekly Total Table lets you enter daily tasks and provides a weekly overview of the minutes (in total) spent on each task.

<ol>
<li>You can insert a task above the current task by clicking on the yellow “+” button or add a task below by clicking on the “Add a new row” cell.</li>
<li>You can delete a row by clicking on the pink “-” button.</li>
</ol>

The Day Tables show you the tasks you need to complete each day.

<ol>
<li>You can edit how long you plan to do each activity and your actual activity duration.</li>
<li>If you reach your activity goal for the day, a checkbox appears that you can actually check off yourself. (I find checking tasks off of my assignment list is deeply satisfying!)</li>
</ol>

There is also a notes section for each Day Table where you can add information. I use this section to note what I accomplished during my session.

The entire task table is stored in local storage so you can refer to your tasks every day.
